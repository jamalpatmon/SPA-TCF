                    <p>
                        Welcome to Trinity Core Fitness!
<br><br>
I've been on the fitness train since my days as a student athlete starting in middle school all the way through college. But after graduation, figuring out why fitness was important to me took some serious soul-searching. Add in navigating the wild ride of motherhood with two little ones & it became obvious that I needed physical activity to be a constant in my life. 
<br><br>
While becoming a mom helped me to truly appreciate what my body is capable of and inspired me to be in better shape to keep up with the whirlwind of energy that are my children, it was a quote from Pastor Mike Todd that really struck a chord: "God will only bless you to the extent your body can handle." That got me thinking about the deep connection between physical activity, overall health, and just taking care of the incredible bodies we've been given.
<br><br>
While looking good is definitely a bonus, it's not the end-all and be-all. We've got to move past the idea of chasing a certain body type and instead focus on optimal function to serve our purpose in this world. That's where the real magic happens.
<br><br>
Here at Trinity Core Fitness, the mission is straightforward: to empower you in making physical activity a seamless part of your life & helping you achieve your highest purpose. I specialize in offering personalized exercise programs designed not only to enhance your physical appearance but also to leave you feeling absolutely fantastic. 
<br><br>
Let's shift away from comparisons and instead focus on moving in a way that honors your unique strengths and abilities. Because believe me, when we prioritize function, everything else aligns beautifully. 
<br><br>
I am excited to embark on this journey together!
